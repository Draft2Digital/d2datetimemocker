#Pull Requests

In general, pull requests are welcome.  Please try to adhere to the following.

- code should conform to PEP8 and as well as the linting done by Pycharm.
- include tests.
- include any relevant documentation updates.

It's a good idea to make pull requests early on.  A pull request represents the
start of a discussion, and doesn't necessarily need to be the final, finished
submission.

GitHub's documentation for working on pull requests is [available here][pull-requests].

Always run the tests before submitting pull requests, and ideally run `tox` in
order to check that your modifications don't break anything.

Once you've made a pull request take a look at the travis build status in the
GitHub interface and make sure the tests are running as you'd expect.
